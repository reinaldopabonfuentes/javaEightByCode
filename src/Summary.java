        * What is Lambda expression
        *   Lambda is equivalen to a function (method) without a name
        *   Lambdas are also referred as Anonymous functions
        *       Method parameters
        *       Method Body
        *       Return Type
        *   Lambdas are not tied to any class like a regular method
        *   Lambda can also be assigned to variable and passed around
        *
        * Usages of Lambda
        *   Lambda is mainly used to implement Functional Interfaces (SAM)
        *   Examples:
        *
        *   @FunctionalInterface
        *   public interface Comparator<T>{
        *       int compare(T o1, T o2);
        *   }
        *
        *   @FunctionalInterface
        *   public interface Runnable(){
        *       void run();
        *  }
        *
        *
        *
        *
        *
        *
        *
